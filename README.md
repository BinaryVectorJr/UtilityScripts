# UtilityScripts
Contains some standalone Unity scripts I made over the years, to help me in my projects. These may not be the best way to do things, but worked as intended without hassle. I am always open to constructive feedback, to better the way I code. [ONGOING]

1. CSV-to-UnityList --> The basic functionality of this script, is to parse any comma separated value file (I was using .txt files) into a readable format in the Unity Inspector (in the form of List that stores a custom class).
